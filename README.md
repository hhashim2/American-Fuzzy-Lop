# American-Fuzzy-Lop
The American Fuzzy Lop is a fuzzer which is efficient in checking code coverage. A fuzzer is a fuzz testing technique in software development which provides invalid, unexpected, and random data to a program. This program is then monitored for memory leakages, crashes, and corner test-cases.
## Fuzzer Implmentation
This implementation adapts a program written in conjunction with Raja Rafey, and runs the American Fuzzer on top of it.
